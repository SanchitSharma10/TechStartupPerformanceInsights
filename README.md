Work in progress.

Please view the files EDA Merged Stock Price and Fundamentals.ipynb to see the merged dataframe for stock price plus the fundamentals for that time period. Additionally,
please view the file EDA Stock and Sentiment Analysis.ipynb to see sentiment analysis via twitter on the same stock.

Work to be done: relationship and analysis of economic indicators with the stock prices, and how they are affecting it. Will add visualizations for each analysis.
